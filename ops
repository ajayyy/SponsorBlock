Is it that they will count as duplicates after the future change you mentioned? If so, then why not make the changes I suggested instead?\n\nEven if we ignore the option of submitting overlapping segments, why is it better to count a credits/sponsor overlap as a sponsor segment instead of a credits segment? Is it just because you're guessing that most people are more likely to skip sponsor segments than credits segments? If so, do you have a complete overlap hierarchy of _all_ the categories?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1593983434,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzkzOTY1MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/402#issuecomment-653939650"},"message":"The categories are meant to be discrete and not overlap.
