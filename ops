I assume that means 3:60 represents a value of 3.59.xxx instead of 4.00.xxx but if so is only a neat trick and of limited use to guess more precise sponsor times as it doesn't do that for the rest fo the second representations.\n  I would still like a way to see a detailed time of segments (make sure an attempt to resubmit more precise timings are useful instead of a headbashing due to imprecise start time use by sponsorblock addon). Those are likely only relevant for those creating the start/stop times","files":null}]}
