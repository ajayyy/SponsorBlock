Video gets loaded\n2. Client parses chapter names and if one contains one of the keywords like `sponsor`, `ad`, `promo`, etc. the client will insert a temporary segment for it and skips that based on the user's set preferences.\n3. Client provides an extra button in the \"Unskip\" dialog to allow quick blacklisting video(/playlist)/channel from the feature\n\nExceptions:\n- If a user-created segment overlaps with the the chapter the chapter will be ignored so user-created segments always have priority\n- There needs to be a user-editable blacklist to disable the feature on certain channels/videos(/playlists)\n- If the chapter to be skipped is longer than ( user-configurable [default 20])% of the video length it will be ignored (to prevent youtubers from just naming the full video as chapter \"ad\" to annoy SB users. [In which case the user can also disable the feature in the aforementioned blacklist for the channel]\n\nPurpose:\nSometimes you're one of the first to see a video and that shouldn't mean that you need to have a disadvantage over  the ones coming after you.  This is not supposed to disencourage people from submitting segments so people that are eager to submit segments will continue to do so and improve the database and the people that just consume will continue, i don't think this will change a lot in submissions tbh","files":null},{"type":2,"author":{"id":"f857c54afb0c59d013bb38f2ab8b10929fe2008a"},"timestamp":1601699331,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzgzNjIwODA4Ng=="},"title":"[Feature Request] Optional setting to auto skip chapters based on name","was":"[Feature Request] Optional setting to auto skip chapters based on name"}]}
