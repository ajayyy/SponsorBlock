This ends up in a pretty jarring jump after half a word of a sponsor slot, for example. It's not a super widespread problem, but I've seen it enough to warrant a report, and I don't think it'd be much work to implement. \n\nOf course, this all applies to the ends of videos too, but this is less common owing to the definite end screen.\n\nIf a marker is placed within half a second or so of the start of the video, the marker should be treated as if it were set at the start of the video. I don't think any meaningful content could appear in a half second segment at the start of the video, so it seems like \na good way of weeding out any slightly off submissions.\n\nFinally, thanks for building and hosting this project. It's made viewing so much nicer.\n\nEdit: I looked at the server, and maybe this is better on the server side, particularly to handle users who don't have an updated extension. Not gonna open a duplicate issue, but might as well mention it.","files":null},{"type":2,"author":{"id":"83295acd27a3caf9f402f16786335cd5f55fb51c"},"timestamp":1599938995,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50Mzc1OTY4NzUzMA=="},"title":"Segment markers set in first ~0.5 seconds of the video should be recorded as exactly 0","was":"Segment markers set in first ~0.5 seconds of the video should be recorded as exactly 0"}]}
