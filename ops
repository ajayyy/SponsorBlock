So for me at least it would be extremely useful to be able to avoid the mouse when setting and submitting a sponsor segment.\n\nAs it is now I can set the start and end of a segment, and then initiate the submission.\nBut that's as far as I can currently get with the keyboard. To actually confirm and submit the segment I have to use the mouse.\n\nIt is possible to use tab to navigate to the submit button an then press enter. But that unsets the focus from the video. So when you next press spacebar the page scrolls instead of the video playing.\n\nIt would be quite nice to have another button to confirm submission of the segment. Perhaps even one for each segment type. Or at least to have another press of the submission button to confirm and send the segment.\n\nMore shortcuts in general would be nice too. Off the top of my head it would be nice to have some to:\n- revert a skip\n- redo a skip after reverting it.\n- jump to the end of a segment\n- manipulate the start and end of a segment / redo a segment submission\n- whitelist / unwhitelist a channel\n- disable and enable for all channels / turn off \u0026 on\n\nThank you very much for creating this wonderful tool. It has literally saved hours of my life =D","files":null}]}
