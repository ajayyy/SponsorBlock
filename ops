All options are stored as just internal variables (in `storage.sync`) and, of course, you can modify them from anywhere in the extension's context (background, popup, userAction, content scripts, even context menus).\nHowever, you already hide options on popup behind a click. That means you already don't have enough space to permanently put them there.
