Clicking start+stop gives an edit with both times being the same but clicking on start will make an entry with a start but no end and has a delete button but no edit button. Clicking on its time does open it for editing but gives NAN for endtime and delete below it but no save button even after filling in an end time. Clicking sponsor stop and start on the video closes the popup (as does start, kind of annoying) and when reopened it will have a complete and editable entry.\n  Using the 'Sponsorship starts/stops now' buttons work from the popup to complete it without closing the popup but always closes any times editors that are open without saving or prompting to do so.","files":null}]}
