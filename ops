The bogus positive votes appears to influence the server into handing out their segment, rather than the existing identical segment from another user.\n\nJust one example of the 10,000+ votes clobbering an existing positive voted segment:\nhttps://sb.ltn.fi/video/6KDBpn8fW78/?sort=-timesubmitted\n\nI'm surprised nobody has noticed this yet.","files":null}]}
