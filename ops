Right now it defaults to sponsor. Some users may find that to not be their primary submission type and could change it. I would prefer to not have it set by default but require that I pick a setting before submission can complete to make sure I don't accidentally submit as a sponsor from a misclicked/rushed/forgotton+overlooked posting.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1593040578,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0Nzk3MjQ3NzI="},"added":["Categories"],"removed":[]}]}
