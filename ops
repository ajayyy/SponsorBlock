When I'm on a channels 'Videos' tab, clicking any of the videos, the SB control will not be added to the newly opened page/tab. Refreshing that page forces the control to be added. Back on a channels 'Videos' tab, refreshing the page before clicking a video, will also force the SB control to be added.\n\nI've disabled all other extensions and can confirm they are not causing the issue.\n\nIs there a 'debug' option so that I may provide further details?","files":null}]}
