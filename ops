Clicking re-skip in the second instance will bring the player to the skipping timestamp of the previous video, but in the current one.\nWell tldr probably disable autoplay when creating a sponsor time or on some other stuff.\nThanks for your great extension!\n\u003e\n\u003e-Someone\n\nDisadvantages: This could make people confused if they accidentally started a submission.","files":null}]}
