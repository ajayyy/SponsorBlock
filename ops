Often if I accessed the settings area to change speed, resolution, etc. then the next time I press spacebar I toggle annotations instead of pause/play. That results in a dynamic interface that has replaced one action with one other action. Sponsorblock ends up with a double action available of play/pause and start/stop endpoint marking all from that single press of space.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1594782798,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDY2ODI1OTk="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1595896392,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1OTIxMjgyMTA="},"added":["help wanted"],"removed":[]}]}
