While watching, the timebar markings failed to hold to the segments based on thumbnail preview; suspect it is from a dynamically lengthening timeline. After airing it went to an edited form where at least the intro countdown timer was gone and no segments matched anymore; have not tested this on videos content creators edit after it had been up for some time but suspect there may be a similar issue.\n  It would be handy to either have live submissions blocked (haven't tested if they work to skip correctly during the live presentation for other viewers), or an easy way to report segment offsets so they could be slid. I think I have had 1-2 other submissions where this could have had an impact but didn't have a chance to review once submitted so hopefully the voting system fixed it. I fixed my most recent attempt with downvote on bad skips and resubmission but not sure I got em all and definitely didn't get em as precise. Not sure how it impacts other addon users as I thought there was an effort to make a single user not receive skips they submitted as bad anymore but leave it in the pool for others. Last video was Ci_eOrWB8b4 (warning, contains non-mainstream political content).","files":null}]}
