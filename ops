I still see the actual background process in the task manager often even when I do not have YouTube and do not have embedded videos. For me, the stack size fell from 3-4 MB to 2-3MB and overall process memory from  28MB to 19MB.\nThis happens because you still have an `chrome.tabs.onActivated` event listener that gets called each time any tab gets activated, so browser evicts the process from memory only if you do not do any tab changes and navigations within the same tab. The should be resolved when this event listener is removed.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1565538757,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDIzOTAwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/88#issuecomment-520239005"},"message":"Thanks for the update and PR! 10 mb is a pretty good reduction in ram.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"dfc05bb8fa6d623104c8b57994efc7063679642c"},"timestamp":1565540083,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU0ODcwNzU5NA=="},"status":2}]}
