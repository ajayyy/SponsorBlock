May be nice to have an option to autoskip outside that area again. For example if clicking on the timeline puts you inside the block, autojump to a point outside it. \n\n  It may be beneficial to consider seeking to a moment shortly before the block so it will then have autoskip kick in. It would seem like a nuisance glitch for a short moment if not a clean transition but would even make left arrow reversing through a video supported instead of reaching a point the keyboard cannot rewind before.\n\n  If implemented, this may impact the 'go back' feature of the popup mentioning it skipped a section that offers to watch the skipped portion so the content block would need to be temporarily disabled when this happens.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1564875247,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk2MTg3Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/67#issuecomment-517961876"},"message":"Yep, this doesn't exist now because of the go back feature.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1598883271,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzgwNTQyNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/67#issuecomment-683805424"},"message":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/124","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1598883272,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzcxMDA4MTM2MQ=="},"status":2}]}
