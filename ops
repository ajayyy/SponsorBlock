It is currently very easy to track user behavior/preferences/history by looking at their submitted segments in the public database. This is particularly worrisome if someone unknowingly leaked their userID allowing for very targeted tracking.\n\nMy feature request/proposed solution is to generate a new userID everytime before POST'ing to `/api/skipSegments` if user has enabled a certain flag. This would be a simple way to improve privacy if users don't want people to know their previously submitted segments. We could be even more aggressive by regenerating the userID anytime the field is accessed so even the server can't as easily correlate users with votes. I'd be happy to try to make a PR if there's interest.","files":null}]}
