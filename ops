I normally fire up each of my edit attempts in a video editor to do frame by frame editing where I watch audio content with it too. I have not always been consistent about where I cut but 'usually' favor a little sponsor showing to keep smooth audio. When there is plenty of before-space to splice in cleanly, sometimes I make the transition around proper timeframes and others I may drift earlier. Reasons for that are either to avoid the sponsorblock not jumping at the exact start time I mark and others are to avoid a more akward pause. I think marking extra early just so the sponsorblock addon skips is bad as it doesn't even jump at the same start time twice in a row so better to make a more precise database for if sponsorblock gets better and also for if third party tools ever start to use it and can use it with precision. Maybe I should write up an example workflow.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1567795831,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODk3MTgxMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/96#issuecomment-528971812"},"message":"More precision, the better.

Would knowing a video or two that likely no one else has submitted to help track my edits?\n  3rd party unrelated content that is just a commercial I block. 1st party if it goes off track in the middle to do so I block. 1st party at the end I may ignore. 3rd party content integrated nicely as content and relevant I'll likely let through. A video that is just sponsored content I haven't marked yet and think should give the user a warning that the content as a whole is sponsored instead of just jumping from the start to the end since some end up being 'sell out' production grade content where the whole video is just an ad in the end. A similar example would be like where ublock origin filters content off of a webpage while loading the rest of the page unless the page itself has a block instruction and then alerts me that I have a filter saying to not load that page at all; I can provide examples in their documentation if that wasn't clear though.

A sloppy edit that slips in a small start/end of the sponsor is much nicer than manually having to seek across it such as with no addon. Options to clean it up more would be good but I've hit transitions like a fade form sponsor back to content with talking starting before the sponsor's video was gone. I then have to make a judgement about where to cut and try to remove fluff words/sentences that are not content relevant if able to be done in a clean and nondistracting way. If not, ive let the audio or video of a sponsor slip in to not damage the normal program content over an edit, though an option of what you want to accept for a jump with multiple choices available in the database for download accordingly would be nice. Some may want to damage content just to avoid being advertized to, for example if it is a sponsor they have a strong dislike for.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1567904764,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTE1OTM5MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/96#issuecomment-529159391"},"message":"I am not annoyed by you, your issues are extremely helpful, keep posting them.
