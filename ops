Some site administrators prefer these URLs\n\u003e over regular ones for simplifying compliance with EU regulations (e.g.,\n\u003e cookie directive or GDPR).

However, I would also recommend disabling all automatic information collection, even if it is enabled globally. I'd leave enabled all information communication explicitly initiated by the user (including video reporting and casting votes on previously skipped segments) but would disable all information collection not initiated by the user (view count). Just consider adding this detail to the privacy policy.\nOptional permissions are kinda a pain to do because you need to interact with the user more and most users do not care.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1566693313,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU4MTY4Mjc0Ng=="},"status":2}]}
