With auto skipping enabled, you can't do this since it keeps auto skipping. If you click on a segment with auto skip enabled, it should not auto skip and it should also give you a prompt to upvote or downvote the segment. Most people usually click on a segment when they want to watch it, so this should be default behaviour.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1603565925,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjAzOTM5NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/524#issuecomment-716039395"},"message":"I'm not sure what you are referring to.

I was clicking on the part 0-1 second before the segment and then 1 second later it reached the segment and auto skipped, so I thought I couldn't watch it. Then I change my suggestion to make it easier to watch the segment from the start. Basically, I want to be able to click the general area of the start of the segment and watch it without auto skipping. I don't want to have to pay close attention and time the segment so it doesn't skip, which is inconvenient.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1603567403,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjA0MjkwMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/524#issuecomment-716042902"},"message":"I see.
