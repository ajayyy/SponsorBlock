Since this addon can make clean transitions when the content creator doesn't splice in the ad in a blurred way such as video and audio are a mix of content+ad represented different for each like content talking while video fades to an ad (i usually leave a dab of ad in to keep content in). Other than someone just not wanting to go to that type of content at all, I see no reason for this to be a default=on for general userbase. If a general user doesn't like the jumps, they can whitelist the channel, turn off the addon, or submit less obtrusive skips (another value for block categories to exist). If they thing the jumps are distracting, they won't like many youtube videos or tv/movies in general as few are a perosn on camera talking without frequently switching to at least another camera on the same person\n  For the few who do block videos, this would be valuable as a way to check which videos of an individual channel page (thinking only for /videos pages or playlists preferrably from the channel) have some blocking vs not when looking at a channel known for always having sponsor content though. If on a new channel, the viewed timebar would work as an indicator (assuming the user is logged in and permitting enough google tracking to enable it) as long as the viewer has always been good about marking the blocks but even a manual 'check them now' button could help. Once different block types gets implemented, it goes back to needing it to be a 'new channel' again. The timebars easily get 'tainted' to no longer represent a video to be fully watched and takes effort to let a video run for a while on a long video to get it to re-mark it as fully viewed instead of partially viewed.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1575010328,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTY3OTg4NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/42#issuecomment-559679884"},"message":"Another idea: AD overlay on videos that are fully ads.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c93347fca6b20fbbede509004331eac163abc9e0"},"timestamp":1575011947,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTY4NjU5Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/42#issuecomment-559686592"},"message":"Could this be added to video title instead of visual indicator, like VIdeo Name[ADVERTISING] or Video Name[SPONSORED] with [] in red.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"937f912fe8c6fbde432505781ebabd3a403786f7"},"timestamp":1581293062,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzkxMDc1MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/42#issuecomment-583910750"},"message":"This would probably be a lot of API requests and affect user privacy.\nProbably would be fine if the data was local","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"72ede5baa206043271544ea02e05beb5c53d5a5b"},"timestamp":1581358952,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDI2NTczMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/42#issuecomment-584265732"},"message":"Privacy would always be a thing if we do not have a local dataset the plugin works from. as would submitting times. Privacy should be the same if it was relabeling just the viewed video's title. If trying to get it to do so before loading the video it would be better privacy from sponsorblock server as it would make sponsorblock server would need to send data about all up-next, recommended, etc. listed videos though at the same time sponsorblock could build up data about what gets listed to you (tracking the tracker) and could become aware of what you pick from it if you navigate videos that way. In any case that would probably be a lot more load on the server.","files":null}]}
