Click the popup button and see what it says.\n\nI see no buttons on the Invidious player (not sure if they're enabled for Invidious) but I did turn them on to test because I usually keep them off. Nothing. I don't see any color coded skips (the yellow part on the seekbar) and  If I click the Sponsorblock icon it doesn't show anything to submit times.  I just see \"disable, set username, options\" for options in the icon. And yes I accepted the permissions upon enabling invidious.\n\nShould've stated before that I'm on 'Firefox 72.0.2 (64-bit)' \u0026 'Sponsor Block 1.2.5'. I haven't had issues when using YouTube. Also I just tested again, YouTube works fine. So it's definitely an issue as far as Invidious goes.","files":null}]}
