A one second ad is easy to test with the left arrow key a few times but long cuts are best seeked with a series of repeated keystrokes or clicking on the timebar. Could also have an option to decide how close to just before the edit tit will jump to as a general setting but a default short time (1-2s or so would likely be good).\n\n  After the jump, a loop over the same edit would be nice too but a repeatedly clickable button or something on hotkey would be very nice already.\n\n  In my experience, each playthrough doesn't comes out identical either so for my first edit I set the start a little earlier than I expected as sometimes frames of the sponsor appeared while other times they were missing. I do not know if that reliability changes by seeking back/forward different amounts or to different times but my quick left arrow previewing to approximately the same place caused variations in each playback.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1564868764,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzk1Njc2MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/66#issuecomment-517956761"},"message":"I think I am misunderstanding what you mean by edit.

Playback then will roll for about 2 seconds and perform the jump from 3min to 4min as it currently does so the cut can be previewed.
