Some site administrators prefer these URLs over regular ones for simplifying compliance with EU regulations (e.g., cookie directive or GDPR). Some users install browser extensions or scripts that automatically switch the URL for a slight improvement in privacy (reducing behavioral tracking, but not the number of ads).\n\nI believe it would be nice if this extension supported this mode as well, however, this feature might need to be optional because if users do not want to be tracked by YouTube, they might not want to be tracked by this extension. Note that it's already possible in modern Chrome/Chromium versions (user can individually disable sites under extension's permissions). Something similar should eventually land in Firefox.","files":null}]}
