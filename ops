To my knowledge no other VIP has done this. Even after their lost their VIP privileges, they abused the system to maliciously remove correct segments by another (non-VIP) user because that user was now at the top of the leader board.\n\nOnly after they lost their VIP privileges did they start complaining about the leader board, despite themselves being the only VIP to have ever done this. The leader board is not a problem; this person is.\n\nKeep this in mind when you consider their suggestions.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c93347fca6b20fbbede509004331eac163abc9e0"},"timestamp":1599423883,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Nzg5MjE0Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/448#issuecomment-687892143"},"message":"@DuckOfDuckness Thank you for your input regarding my issue/suggestion.\n\nPlease keep personal issues outside of professional and/or enterprise environments.
