Then, this can auto skip it or just become a skip ad button maybe.\n\nAs a user, I would be confused if an extension's UI was indistinguishable from a site's own UI. I would like to know when the \"skip\" button is YouTube's own skip button (and thus can not skip a part of the video) and when it is extension's skip (and thus might be inaccurate, I might need to un-skip it). Knowing this distinction saves some amount of time during \"debugging\".\n\n### Add indication of skippable segments on the scrub bar\nAs a user, I would like to know how many \"skips\" a video has and where they are located in the context of the video. The timestamps are very counterintuitive (and are hidden unless I click to open a popup or side menu). Thus I believe a bar on the video scrub bar for each skippable segment would be better. E.g., here are two slightly different designs (I'm graphically challenged, so I use Pant):\n1. The yellow bar indicates a skippable segment, complete with start and end marks. If you hover on it, it reveals real timestamps, if you need them. I painted it yellow to contrast with red, grey and black, but it can be any color not used by YouTube UI.\n2. The second section also has a \"cross\" button on it, which user can click if that segment turned out to be not a sponsored segment. The button disables skipping of that segment and might even cast \"thumbs down\" vote automatically.\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45960703/62588181-720d9080-b88a-11e9-8324-a67cc98b1f68.png)\n\n### The duration of \"skip warning\" display should be customizable\nNo matter how extension communicates its intent to skip a section of the video, the duration of that warning should be customizable. E.g., someone might want to see this notification for 5 seconds, someone might want it displayed for 10 seconds to have time to move the mouse, someone (e.g., me) might want it to pop up for just a second and not obstruct the video.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1565143855,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODkxMDgwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/27#issuecomment-518910805"},"message":"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/603643299961503761/606876505699647524/unknown.png)\n\nThis is one of the ways I was thinking of doing it and is how another similar extension does it.
