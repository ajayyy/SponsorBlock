Very good catch. IIRC Since 2016 full screen behaves differently when navigating â€” it doesn't reload the page only replaces all its contents. And the URL bar doesn't even update until you exit full screen at which time the page also reloads. Horrible.\nAnyway, to clarify further:\nI submitted a new sponsor time from within an incognito window for a livestream (archive).\nI then kept watching the same video for an hour.\nAt the end, YouTube Autoplay redirected me to the up next video (I hate that feature!)\nAnd this next video also displayed a purple bar as if I had submitted sponsor for that video as well.\nAnd yeah, it started playback from the 7 minute mark as that's what I submitted (but for the LAST video not this one)\nMy new userID on sponsor.ajay.app / SponsorBlock is simply: 3ICE\nIt says I have one submission, so it wasn't duplicated in the DB, only locally.","files":null},{"type":2,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1578768890,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50Mjk0MDc4MDU1Ng=="},"title":"Fullscreen videos don't change URL","was":"Old YouTube Fullscreen videos don't change URL"},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1578768949,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzM0NDQwNw==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/233#issuecomment-573344407"},"message":"Same issue as https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/150\n\nHere was the first try to solve this: https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/pull/125","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1578769193,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzM0NDcwMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/233#issuecomment-573344700"},"message":"@3ICE By the way, you might like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stop-youtube-autoplay/npcghnpganhnghapekiicaeiobnhbbfa","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1578769193,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdDMzNjIzMDY3NQ=="},"target":"8d7cb3ec77b69d2cb90e4b2c315ca929041db4fe643fa3d0a6d4db90257254fc","message":"@3ICE By the way, you might like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stop-youtube-autoplay/npcghnpganhnghapekiicaeiobnhbbfa.
