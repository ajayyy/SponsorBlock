Video gets loaded\n2. Client parses chapter names and if one contains one of the keywords like `sponsor`, `ad`, `promo`, etc. the client will insert a temporary segment for it and skips that based on the user's set preferences.\n3. Client provides an extra button in the \"Unskip\" dialog to allow quick blacklisting video(/playlist)/channel from the feature\n\nExceptions:\n- If a user-created segment overlaps with the the chapter the chapter will be ignored so user-created segments always have priority\n- There needs to be a user-editable blacklist to disable the feature on certain channels/videos(/playlists)\n- If the chapter to be skipped is longer than ( user-configurable [default 20])% of the video length it will be ignored (to prevent youtubers from just naming the full video as chapter \"ad\" to annoy SB users. [In which case the user can also disable the feature in the aforementioned blacklist for the channel]","files":null}]}
