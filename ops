This is how I know that SponsorBlock starts the skip too late. Even though I set the beginning time correctly, when previewing, I see that it doesn't skip until later. I try to set the times exactly right, so I end up having to edit the start up back 0.05s at a time until the cut is accurate.\n\nThis usually requires reducing the time the cut starts by 0.2 to 0.3 seconds.\n\nTested on the latest version of Firefox.","files":null}]}
