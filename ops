I have noticed that while my button is always added to the bar, SBs buttons are sometimes missing. This appears to be a race condition between the two extensions.\n\nMy button is added as:\n```js\nconst button_bar = player.getElementsByClassName(\"ytp-right-controls\")[0]\nif (button_bar)\n  button_bar.insertBefore(this.__elements.button, button_bar.firstElementChild)\n```\n\nWhile I don't mind changing my code to play nice with SB, this issue must lie within SB itself and conflicts with other extensions may occur.","files":null}]}
