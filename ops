Mouse navigation seems to work a bit weird on that page at least in my browser (because it's optimized for TVs) so I don't know how easy it'd be to add the sponsor spot report buttons, but the playback feature (skipping spots that are already reported) should work similar to the normal YouTube page.","files":null}]}
