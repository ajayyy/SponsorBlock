However this is a fixed ratio, which makes sense only for some videos. On a popular video with millions of views there might be hundreds of upvotes, making -10 not worth much. However on a video with a handful of upvotes, -10 may be too much. The real solution would be to make them equal weight again, but disable auto upvote by default.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1595086815,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDUwMDI4OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/411#issuecomment-660500289"},"message":"Auto upvoted was removed completely at the same time as the categories update.
