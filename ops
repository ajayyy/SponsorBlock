Thanks so much for sponsorblock, it's awesome.\n\nI was very happy to see the introduction of categories as there were a bunch of things that weren't strictly sponsors that bugged me (self-promotion in particular), but this has caused me a bit of a problem because for certain channnels I want to see things like end credits, but for most channels I don't. So I'd suggest adding the ability to disable sponsorblock for certain channels.\n\nBeing able to disable the whole thing on a per-channel basis would be a step in the right direction, but even better would be more fine-grained controls which would allow users to disable/enable sponsorblock on a per-category-per-channel basis, giving me the ability to say e.g \"skip categories X and Y by default but for videos on this channel skip only category Z\".\n\nThanks for your time :)","files":null}]}
