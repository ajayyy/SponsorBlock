SB in its default form has 2 (open and starts-now ). Clicking start will add the clear, clicking stop will add the submit; giving a total of 4 buttons.\n\nThese 7 buttons are too much for the all mighty google's youtube to handle. The whole \".ytp-right-controls\" bar will flow to the next row, with parent having overflow hidden, it disappears from view.\n\nNo fault of a single extension, but combined...\n\nMy mutate button mentioned above offers 4 additional buttons (rotate L/R, flip V/H). Also, since I deem it not very important, I've appended rather then prepended. These 4 buttons are diplayed in a popout when the main button is hovered. I mention this because I think a solution to the disappearing toolbar is to add the rightmost buttons to a dropdown/dropup (with last visible button icon in the bar being a simple triangle which can be hovered).\n\nThoughts, ideas?\n\nAny extension which adds buttons is going to face the same issue. Adding too many buttons breaks the bar for every extension. We need an extension/developer friendly solution.\n\nI propose both of our extensions add a fix, but to be friendly, a data attribute should be added to the \".ytp-right-controls\" element which would signify to a later loading extension that the problem has been fixed. \n\nUpdate: Just noticed that hovering the volume, produces its slider, which also eats into the button bar real estate.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1586121308,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQ4NDUwOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/316#issuecomment-609484509"},"message":"Maybe there is a way to detect the number of height in lines?","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1586121308,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdElzc3VlQ29tbWVudEVkaXQ6MzYzMDg4OTMx"},"target":"4534582011fb323b156339b067c45db80dec84708214f33a888373886a6fa95e","message":"Maybe there is a way to detect the height in number of lines?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1586121435,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTQ4NDY1Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/316#issuecomment-609484657"},"message":"Full screen also grants more space.
