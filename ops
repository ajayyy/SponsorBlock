It works well enough for me although still a little clunky.\n\nInstantly seeing the changes would be cool, but I can also see it getting annoying. Plus if you do it frame by frame, you're a lot less likely to need to see the preview multiple times. Ultimately I think that creating segments has to be faster, but I am not qualified to say what a good/bad approach to that is.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e1590605a6846b441cf191db494161142e4bc885"},"timestamp":1602658393,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODIwMDI2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/497#issuecomment-708200269"},"message":"I can also recommend just using the frames to properly mark segments. you'll never be as precise as using frames directly","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"33dfbe8284af2c3eb3b2ea18521724060e8b1369"},"timestamp":1602660071,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODIxMzA1OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/497#issuecomment-708213059"},"message":"Oh nice, just checked this site: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7631406\n\nI have tried comma and period keys, but they haven't had the right effect.
