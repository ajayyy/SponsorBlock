That is not accounted for when submitting. After refreshing - and the premier being over - it was basically shifted 2 minutes ahead.\n\nI'm not sure that you can just subtract 2 minutes and it being accurate.\n\nSo I suggest deactivating the upload for premiere videos, while they are premiering.","files":null}]}
