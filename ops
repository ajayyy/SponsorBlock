The reason is that sqlite3 is \"asynchronous\" even though all the computation still happens on the same thread. This means the only thing it being async does is it increases the overhead significantly. (The reason it's more popular is as far as I know only because node devs fear stuff that is synchronous without really understanding what happens behind the scenes.)","files":null}]}
