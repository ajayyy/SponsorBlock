(would be hard to track the time saved though)\n\nExample where this would be useful.\nYou search up how to do a specific thing, you find a good video about it, but the maker spends like 3 years talking about some other stuff before finally saying the answer.\n![EXAMPLE1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58611480/94595549-4833dc00-028b-11eb-9d5e-fed4d827f3a2.png)\n![EXAMPLE2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58611480/94595552-49650900-028b-11eb-8cc3-cc2cb0216b37.png)\nNote that the example images does not reflect a video where it is would be useful, just a random Tom Scott video from the recommended recommended page that I quickly edited to make an example with.","files":null}]}
