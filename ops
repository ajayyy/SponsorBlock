It automatically finds chromecasts and polls them for what they're playing / where the playhead is, and automatically fetches segments from sponsorblock api. Then it can automatically seek forward any time it hits a sponsor. It's a little rough (since the cli only allows skipping integer seconds, and because there's no skip to absolute position, you get a second of ad on either side, and I think there's an occasional error) but it works :D","files":null}]}
