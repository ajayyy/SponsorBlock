While doing this I found the interface for reporting a\n\u003e sponsor confusing.\n\u003e\n\u003e I found the interface to be a real pain to use. Is the stop button stop or\n\u003e pause? When I click play again am I resuming or starting again? Is there\n\u003e some way to clear what I've already recorded?\n\u003e\n\u003e After trying a few times I think I ended up somehow making the recorded\n\u003e sponsor far too small (video in question\n\u003e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odscT429m-g).\n\u003e\n\u003e I think that an easy (I think) solution to this would be to have a dialog\n\u003e come up whenever you push submit which says the times you've selected, and\n\u003e gives you an option to change it before submitting.\n\u003e\n\u003e Also a couple of other points of feedback while I'm here, don't use\n\u003e browser notifications (or at least make them opt-out), they suck. I've\n\u003e already gotten dozens of \"Do you want to submit the sponsor time\"\n\u003e notifications flooding me. If I wanted to submit the sponsor time I already\n\u003e would have. The Chrome extension link is broken (or maybe removed from the\n\u003e web store).\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you.\n\u003e\n\u003e â€”\n\u003e You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n\u003e Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/issues/45?email_source=notifications\u0026email_token=ADAZV4HCPKCLOCWEJP5IACTQB2O7DA5CNFSM4IHPXA7KYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFUVEXG43VMWVGG33NNVSW45C7NFSM4HB7GZGQ\u003e,\n\u003e or mute the thread\n\u003e \u003chttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADAZV4CN72BPXWYQP5EKHT3QB2O7DANCNFSM4IHPXA7A\u003e\n\u003e .\n\u003e","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"969fe24ee4082d52977026a04efd671fd5270344"},"timestamp":1564412870,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdDI1NTkyNzY5OQ=="},"target":"851f537eaedfb9085e31958c2a96a05727e6e6d8d12ae67c270465b6b46bdccd","message":"Yea, sorry.
