If entries in the DB are never modified and only appended this is a trivial change but otherwise would require some engineering.\n\nMaybe at least locally having a simple list of only all video IDs in the DB first would save a lot of requests. The extension could then only do a network request to look up the sponsorship times when a video with the given ID is found in the local list. Additionally to that it could be combined with ajayyy/SponsorBlockServer#25. This could also be stored with less memory usage.\n\nsee also: #137","files":null}]}
