A one second ad is easy to test with the left arrow key a few times but long cuts are best seeked with a series of repeated keystrokes or clicking on the timebar. Could also have an option to decide how close to just before the edit tit will jump to as a general setting but a default short time (1-2s or so would likely be good).\n  After the jump, a loop over the same edit would be nice too but a repeatedly clickable button or something on hotkey would be very nice already.\n  In my experience, each playthrough doesn't comes out identical either so for my first edit I set the start a little earlier than I expected as sometimes frames of the sponsor appeared while other times they were missing. I do not know if that reliability changes by seeking back/forward different amounts or to different times but my quick left arrow previewing to approximately the same place caused variations in each playback.","files":null}]}
