Like I don't even get the (purple I think it was?) segment appearing in my time bar, and when I reload the video it is just not there at all.\nI believe it happens most often when there already is another segment uploaded for the same video. Like someone reported the sponsor at the end, but not in the intro. Not sure it is the cause though.\n\nBTW, thank you very much for this incredible extension!","files":null}]}
