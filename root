As many users have auto skip enabled, this would add many silent upvotes.\n\nThis is a problem. The part of users that actively curate the database and care about correct tags is surely the minority.\n\nConsider a hugely popular video with a wrong tag. Then the many users all add silent upvotes for the wrong tag. The few explicit down votes from users trying to curate the database get lost in the sea of silent upvote.\n\nI can't find an option to disable auto upvote in the settings. But maybe I'm just missing it. I don't think it's \"Enable Sponsor Skip Count Tracking\" though?\n\nBut most importantly, auto upvote should be disabled by default and optional to activate. This allows advanced users to easily upvote by their absence of a downvote, but prevent the skewing of the votes by beginner users that are unaware of the silent upvote mechanism.","files":null}]}
