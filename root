This can be fine when the correct certs happen to be installed but if the local certificate store for example doesn't yet have the LE certs trusted, the x-signing certs are needed.\nThis can be achieved \n* with nginx set `ssl_certificate` to the `fullchain.pem` file in the folder containing the domain certs, not to `cert.pem`\n* with apache: Add a `SSLCertificateChainFile` line that points to the `chain.pem` file in the cert folder.\n\nSorry for reporting this here but I didn't find a more suitable place.","files":null}]}
