Sometimes can be confusing seeing most significant digits (left digits) incorrectly due to the view having panned right while editing it. Not sure if the player will ever support proper jumping to thousandths of a second but external uses may.\n  Another option could be to display fractional seconds as framecount within that second. Don't know if YouTube allows large framerate differences but smaller edit precision can be useful for cleaner cuts on audio and some podcasts and similar audio only content is present on YouTube.","files":null}]}
