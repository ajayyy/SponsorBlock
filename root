This permission is [necessary](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs) to populate `url`, `title`, and `favIconUrl` properties of `Tab` objects, which you never use in the scripts. I think, you use it only to infer the current tab to populate the popup interface. Instead, Chrome has [`\"activeTab\"`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/activeTab) permission that provides this information and does not display any warning message on install.\n\nSwitching to `\"activeTab\"` would require a small patch, not just removing `\"tabs\"` from the manifest. If you are interested, I can prepare this patch and make a PR.","files":null}]}
