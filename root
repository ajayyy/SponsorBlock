How should we users submit times in cases like this? The naive answer is to just submit overlapping times, so that if one user had credits set to auto-skip but not sponsors, and another had their settings the other way around, they would each supposedly get their intended behaviour. But I think the database's process of trying not to send \"duplicate\" segments to viewers ruins this strategy. Perhaps there should be a server-side change such that overlapping segments of different categories should not count as duplicates if a large fraction of either segment is non-overlapping, and/or if each category has a submission from the same user?","files":null}]}
