This is probably your ad blocker. Please check https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/wiki/Fix-Ad-Blocker-Blocking-SponsorBlock's-Requests\n\nNone of the URLs in the Wiki are being blocked from what I can tell, in the uBO logs, Firefox devtools and browser console. I tried adding the recommended settings to my uBO filter list but there was no difference. Playing with Firefox' tracking, privacy and autoplay controls made no difference either.\n\nI do not have any other network or DNS-type blockers installed. \n\n## Examples\n\n    \u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhGIf8KP2-w\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis particular video does not have SponsorBlock data (very short video), the alert is shown\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/ryo5wsak/\n\nThis video has endcards in the SB database, the alert is shown, and the SB data is still being loaded successfully (setting endcards - show in timeline)\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nsqk5p3f/","files":null}]}
