For example:\n - Channel promoting their own merchandise/Patreon\n - Promoting another YouTube channel as a collaboration\n - Intro/title segments (not really a sponsorship, but some people may want to skip these).\n\nOpen to suggestions on categories, though it's probably best to keep it simple.","files":null}]}
