Here it is in full:\n\n\u003e A cookie associated with a cross-site resource at http://ajay.app/ was set without the `SameSite` attribute. A future release of Chrome will only deliver cookies with cross-site requests if they are set with `SameSite=None` and `Secure`. You can review cookies in developer tools under Application\u003eStorage\u003eCookies and see more details at https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592 and https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032.\n\nI thought it would be good to get ahead of this, if possible, to avoid future issues.","files":null}]}
