I'm using it mostly through YouTube Vanced. Has been so helpful!\n\nAs a possible avenues to expand, it would be nice to support more places. Besides other websites, I'm also talking about providing functionality similar to Netflix's skip functionalities. E.g. if segments are known for a TV show, and say the Kodi (or the up next) plugin is updated to use these, it can figure out when the show stops for real, and when starts for real, allowing for a huge amount of time saving when binging shows.","files":null}]}
