May be nice to have an option to autoskip outside that area again. For example if clicking on the timeline puts you inside the block, autojump to a point outside it. \n  It may be beneficial to consider seeking to a moment shortly before the block so it will then have autoskip kick in. It would seem like a nuisance glitch for a short moment if not a clean transition but would even make left arrow reversing through a video supported instead of reaching a point the keyboard cannot rewind before.\n  If implemented, this may impact the 'go back' feature of the popup mentioning it skipped a section that offers to watch the skipped portion so the content block would need to be temporarily disabled when this happens.","files":null}]}
