I have multiple times nearly reoved segments because I wasn't paying attention to where I was clicking and a new segment box was popping up. \nIf the segment boxes came from above and stacked onto each other it would help this.\n\nAnother prolem is when you skip the same segment multiple times it will show multiple boxes instead of one. This is fine for one segment, but when you view multiple segments in rapid sucession it can make segments disappear, because another segment comes up twice. If for each UUID only one box would pop up it would greatly improve the situation","files":null}]}
