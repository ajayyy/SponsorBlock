I've checked on multiple videos, and the option to add a new skip is gone, instead there is just the text \n\n\u003e No YouTube video found at this tab. If you know this is a YouTube tab, close this popup and open it again. If that does not work, try reloading the tab.\n\nSkips still load correctly and other users can add new skips, but I can't. I can mark times and everything else, but just the options to submit and vote on times is missing.\n\nThings I've tried to fix it:\n- refreshing the tab\n- closing and reopening the tab\n- closing and reopening Firefox\n- turning off uBlock\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1241\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-10 at 1 18 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2348127/74177993-b6f7f280-4c32-11ea-95ff-efbdfc32298d.png\"\u003e","files":null}]}
