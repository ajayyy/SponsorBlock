Feel free to do whatever with this.\n\n1. **Reskip button after unskipping**\nIt'd make a lot easier to check if an actual advertisement is happening if you could reskip after you clicked to unskip ('go back' button). Keep the window open for a bit more time to allow for that.\n\n2. **Close timer - pausing/resetting it**\nIt'd be nice to see the time ticking down. As a bonus, that allows for you to pause time when the user hovers the screen, as you could show that visually with a pause icon (and pausing when hovering is good as it gives you some time to think).\n\n3. **Instead of not showing at all, at least show an icon**\nI'd definitely recommend having an option for a cirular icon instead of all or nothing. It let's you know that, \"yes, this sudden skip was the ad being skipped\", while not being as intrusive. It also gives the person a chance to click it and dislike/unskip the ad.\n\n4. **Improve window layout, look simpler/smaller**\nBelow you can see my take on it, plus using the suggestions above (feel free to do whatever with that, you can copy it fully if you want). I also decided to put the window inside the player, in the top-right, as I felt the current location was awkward (and breaks in fullscreen).\n\n![](https://files.catbox.moe/c2pxfo.png)","files":null}]}
