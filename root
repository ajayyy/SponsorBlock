While doing this I found the interface for reporting a sponsor confusing. \n\nI found the interface to be a real pain to use. Is the stop button stop or pause? When I click play again am I resuming or starting again? Is there some way to clear what I've already recorded?\n\nAfter trying a few times I think I ended up somehow making the recorded sponsor far too small (video in question https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odscT429m-g).\n\nI think that an easy (I think) solution to this would be to have a dialog come up whenever you push submit which says the times you've selected, and gives you an option to change it before submitting.\n\nAlso a couple of other points of feedback while I'm here, don't use browser notifications (or at least make them opt-out), they suck. I've already gotten dozens of \"Do you want to submit the sponsor time\" notifications flooding me. If I wanted to submit the sponsor time I already would have. The Chrome extension link is broken (or maybe removed from the web store).\n\nThank you.","files":null}]}
