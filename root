With auto skipping enabled, you can't do this since it keeps auto skipping. If you click on a segment with auto skip enabled, it should not auto skip and it should also give you a prompt to upvote or downvote the segment. Most people usually click on a segment if they want to watch it, so this should be default behaviour.","files":null}]}
