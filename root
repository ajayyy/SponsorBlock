Next space starts marking the next time marker. This happens because youtube uses space as play/pause if nothing else is focused and clicks on the last clicked part of the interface if something else has that focus. Not sure why youtube chose 'k' as an alternate as I have not seen that used anywhere else when other players have had other play/pause keys in use.\n  On a related note, is there a fast way to undo an (accidental) endmark or one whole segment other than hitting submit and editing form there?","files":null}]}
