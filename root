SponsorBlock doesn't seem to be working at all. I can see the green segments on the playback bar, the addon page opens as usual, but the segments aren't getting skipped at all. I've tried refreshing the browser (Firefox lets you purge everything, including preferences and addons, and strart fresh), going into settings of SponsorBlock and making sure auto-skip is enabled, but nothing is working. Any ideas?","files":null}]}
