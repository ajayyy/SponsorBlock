The colored segment shows up on the seek bar, but once playback reaches that point, the skip does not happen if the video has played naturally since autostarting upon the tab being opened. If I however manually skip to a few seconds before the sponsor segment starts, it will skip as expected.\n\nI'm running SponsorBlock under Firefox 80.0.1 on Kubuntu 20.04 LTS. The only other extension I have that touches the DOM of the page is uBlock Origin. Any ideas on how to remedy this, or is it a bug? Did a cursory search through the issues here and can't find anything similar.","files":null}]}
