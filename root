However, for things like intro sequences - on some channels, I quite enjoy them, where on others I'd just like to skip them.\n\nSo, it'd be lovely if it was possible to have an \"Always skip \u003ccategory\u003e on this channel\" option. It could be shown on the skip prompt when it is set to manual.","files":null}]}
